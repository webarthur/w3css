## W3.CSS
[W3.CSS](https://github.com/JaniRefsnes/w3css) is a CSS microframework with support for desktop, tablet, and mobile design by default.

## Usage
Use this as a base to build websites for clients or to build completely custom themes from scratch. If you're creating your own theme or client project, open up all files and do a "Find and Replace All in All Files" on the word "w3css" with your own slug and prefix.
